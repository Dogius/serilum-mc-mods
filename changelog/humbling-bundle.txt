Changelog:
Humbling Bundle
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/humbling-bundle

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated Humbling Bundle to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.3: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Updated modid.
Fixed picked up armour and equipment being doubled too. Just entity drops from the loot table now! :)

=========
v1.1: Fixed a bug where player loot was being doubled too.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
