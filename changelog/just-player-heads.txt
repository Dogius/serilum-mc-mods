Changelog:
Just Player Heads
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-player-heads

=========
v1.8: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.7: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.6: Updated Just Player Heads to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.5: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.4: Added a cache for player head textures. Can be disabled in the config. The cache is emptied on a server reboot or when an administrator uses the '/jph cache' command.

=========
v1.3: Fixed problem of mod not loading correctly in previous 1.16.x versions.
Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.16.2.

=========
