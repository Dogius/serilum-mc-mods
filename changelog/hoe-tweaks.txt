Changelog:
Hoe Tweaks
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hoe-tweaks

=========
v1.9: Added the onlyUntillWithOtherHandEmpty config option, which allows placing seeds while holding them in the offhand.
Added compatibility with Advanced Netherite.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v1.7: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.6: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.4: Fixed a hoe going into negative durability instead of breaking when tilling a large area.

=========
v1.3: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.2: Fixed falling through a farmland block when un-tilling it while standing on top of it.

=========
v1.1: Added compatibility with Simply Steel's modded hoes.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
