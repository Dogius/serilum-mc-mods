Changelog:
Scaffolding Drops Nearby
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/scaffolding-drops-nearby

=========
v1.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Scaffolding Drops Nearby to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Improved code efficiency. Fixed nullpointerexception caused by incompatibility with other mod.

=========
v1.1: The mod now works with any scaffolding tower height.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
