Changelog:
Stack Refill
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/stack-refill

=========
v1.9: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.8: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.7: Updated Stack Refill to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.6: Increased compatibility with other mods.

=========
v1.5: Thrown eggs can now be replaced. Removed debug console logs accidentally left in.

=========
v1.4: Fixed water buckets being replaced when catching fish. Improved support for modded blocks, such as a sieve from Ex Nihilo.

=========
v1.3: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.2: Added compatibility for milk buckets and fishing rods.

=========
v1.1: The mod can now replace items being tossed on the ground.

=========
