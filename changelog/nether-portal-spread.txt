=========
v4.6: Updated Nether Portal Spread to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

v4.5: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========

=========
v4.2: Improved how the mod handles portals in unloaded chunks.

=========
v4.1: NullPointerException hotfix.

=========
v4.0: The mod has been almost completely rewritten. It now saves portal locations in ./world-folder/data/netherportalspread/portals/, and detects portals when a player creates one or when someone goes through an inactive portal from the nether to the overworld. This makes the mod a lot more efficient.
The spread code now runs entirely on the main thread, solving incompatibility problems with other mods which caused crashes.
Added option (enabled by default) which displays portal coordinates in portal messages.
Added a new default config for Minecraft version 1.16, which uses a lot of the new blocks.

Added configurable message to broadcast to players within the radius when a portal is broken.

Added a feature to the mod where on portal creation a message is send to player around the portal informating them of the spread, and how to stop it.
