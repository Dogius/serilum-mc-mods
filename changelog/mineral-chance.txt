Changelog:
Mineral Chance
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mineral-chance

=========
v1.7: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: Now using BlockTags to determine overwold and nether ores. Added separate config to have different mineral chances for overworld and nether ores. Overworld by default 1/50, nether 1/100.

=========
v1.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Mineral Chance to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Added config option 'ignoreFakePlayers', enabled by default. Prevents simulated players (for example when another mod breaks a stone block) from dropping minerals.

=========
v1.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed minerals dropping for players in creative mode.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
