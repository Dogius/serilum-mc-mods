Changelog:
Transcending Trident
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/transcending-trident

=========
v5.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.2: Increased mod compatibility by disabling mixins when another mod changes the target method, which before this would cause a hard crash.

=========
v2.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.0: The mod has been completely rewritten. It's now much more compatible with other mods and more efficient. Fixes an incompatibility with Quark specifically.

=========
v1.7: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated backend code.

=========
v1.4: Updated Transcending Trident to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: FixedÂ mustHoldBucketOfWater config option not working correctly.

=========
v1.2: Fixed formatting error in mods.toml

=========
v1.1: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
