Changelog:
Random Mob Effects
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-mob-effects

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: Added config option, enabled by default, which disables giving creepers a random mob effect. This due to them creating an area of a lingering effect which is probably not what you want. Feel free to enable them again though!

=========
v1.5: Synchronized versions. Updated mod to work with renamed ForgeRegistries field in 37.0.22.

=========
v1.4: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.2: Updated Random Mob Effects to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.1: Fixed the potion effect level which was 1 too high than the config specified.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
