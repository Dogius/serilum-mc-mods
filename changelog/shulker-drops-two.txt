Changelog:
Shulker Drops Two
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shulker-drops-two

=========
v1.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated Shulker Drops Two to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Updated modid.

=========
v1.2: Updated mods.toml
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid. The mod can now be server-side only, or both the client and the server.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
