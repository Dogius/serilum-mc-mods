Changelog: 
Villager Names
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villager-names

=========
v3.8: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.7: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.5: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.5: (Fabric only) Fixed incorrect mod URL.

=========
v3.4: Added support for all alphabets within the custom names file. E.g. cyrillic and georgian.

=========
v3.3: Improved compatibility for villagers with modded professions.

=========
v3.2: Villagers with a nametag with custom style will now keep that style when interacting with them.

=========
v3.1: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v3.0: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.9: Updated Villager Names to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.
