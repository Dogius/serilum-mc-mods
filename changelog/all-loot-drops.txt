All Loot Drops
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/all-loot-drops

=========
v2.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.2: Updated All Loot Drops to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.1: Fixed old name format in mod reference. Fixed mobs not always dropping all their loot.

=========
v2.0: Updated mod name and modid.
Improved code efficiency.
The mod now works with any entity that has a loot table, modded included. It uses the Collective library to procedurally generate all possible drops on first load.
Added two config options, which allow the looting enchant to have an effect on loot quantity.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.3: Improved compatibility with other mods.

=========
