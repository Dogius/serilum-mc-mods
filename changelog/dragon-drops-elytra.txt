Dragon Drops Elytra
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragon-drops-elytra

=========
v1.5: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Dragon Drops Elytra to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Better support for multiplayer environments. The elytra drop message is now broadcasted to all players in the End, and the player who did the final damage gets an extra message saying the elytra dropped at their feet.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
