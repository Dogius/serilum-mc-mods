Changelog:
Advancement Screenshot
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/advancement-screenshot

=========
v3.0: The mod now works separate from the in-game chat, adding support for other languages than English.

=========
v2.0: Fixed the mod not working correctly when installed on the client and playing in a multiplayer environment. It is now completely client based.

=========
v1.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Advancement Screenshot to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Fixed the mod preventing a server from launching when included in the mods folder. This is a client-side only mod, but the server will ignore it when present.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
