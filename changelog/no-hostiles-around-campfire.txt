Changelog:
No Hostiles Around Campfire
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-hostiles-around-campfire

=========
v3.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v3.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v3.3: Now checks if a campfire is placed unlit. And if unlit, will not burn entities around. Adds compatibility with others mods.

=========
v3.2: Updated No Hostiles Around Campfire to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v3.1: Added compatibility for potential modded campfire blocks. Fixed issue when checking for a lit campfire. Updated modid.

=========
v3.0: Improved mod efficiency.
Added config options 'campfireMustBeSignalling', 'enableEffectForNormalCampfires'(1.16+), 'enableEffectForSoulCampfires'(1.16+)
Fixed mod not working correctly with mob spawners and 'preventMobSpawnerSpawns' enabled.

=========
v2.4: Improved distance calculations for entities around the campfire. Both to prevent spawn and when they should burn on placement. Should work as intended now.
Moved code to check for passengers from the collective library mod to no hostiles around campfire.

=========
v2.3: Improved code efficiency.
Switched dependency from FAB Library to the Collective library mod.

=========
v2.2: The effect by default now only works when a campfire is lit. This can be toggled in the config.

Campfires are now instantly detected when placed.

=========
v2.0: Lots of code rewritten, bugs fixed.
The mod is now dependent on FAB (Find A Block) Library, which efficiently keeps track of blockstates in the world. In this case we want to of course check for a campfire block nearby.
New config options.

=========
v1.4: The mod should now work with all modded entities which are classified as a monster, via EntityClassification.
