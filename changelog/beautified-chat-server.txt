Changelog:
Beautified Chat Server
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/beautified-chat-server

=========
v1.6: (Forge 1.19) The messages sent in the server now show up in the console and in logs.

=========
v1.5: (Forge 1.19) Fixed mod not loading correctly server-side. Messages are now sent via the system.
Updated backend code.

=========
v1.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.2: (Fabric only) Updated mod to work with changes made in Collective (Fabric) v3.15.

=========
v1.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
