Changelog:
Tree Harvester
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tree-harvester

=========
v3.1: Saplings placed on custom dirt (e.g. modded, podzol, coarse) are now placed correctly after tree harvest. The mod now relies on Collective's Block Compare functions.

=========
v3.0: Added support for the warped trees in the nether. This can be disabled in the config. Improved support for modded saplings.

=========
v2.9: Fixed the 1.12.2 version not working on servers. Extended compatibility for modded trees by using BlockTags.

=========
v2.8: Fixed the mod thinking flowers and grass around the tree were leaves. Now only actual leaves are broken (fast leaf decay) when chopping down a tree.

=========
v2.7: Updated mod to work with the new Tool functions in Collective. Updated 1.17.1 version for changes in 37.0.24.

=========
v2.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v2.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.4: Updated Tree Harvester to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.3: Improved a lot of backend code. The mod is now correctly runs events to make it compatible with other statistic mods. Improved fast leaf decay for bigger trees. Fixed modded tool durability behaving incorrectly.

=========
v2.2: Fixed issue of saplings not being replaced. Fixed issues of axes not breaking correctly. Improved code efficiency. Improved the way the mod chooses the correct sapling from drops.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Added fast leaf decay function. The sapling can get replaced after the last leaf block has been broken.

=========
v1.7: The mod is now compatible with other mods that add a broken-tool variant instead of removing the axe on reaching the maximum durability damage.

=========
v1.6: Changed the default config value of 'instantBreakLeavesAround' from true to false.

=========
v1.5: Added config option 'instantBreakLeavesAround' which can be set to false to prevent leaf brocks from being broken when chopping down a tree.

=========
v1.4: [1.16.2 only] Fixes ClassCastException when chopping down a tree.

=========
v1.3: Improved mod efficiency.
Improved function to find and break all leaves around trees using the amount of logs found.
Added config option (enabled by default) to increase exhaustion per log harvested. Same behaviour as vanilla when breaking a block.

=========
v1.2: Separated sound code to client-only. The mod now works in multiplayer environments again.

=========
v1.1: The mod now works with all modded trees.
Fixed sound spam when using the mod to chop down a tree.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
