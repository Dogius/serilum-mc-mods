Changelog:
Double Doors
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/double-doors

=========
v3.6: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.5: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.6: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.3: Fixed weighted plates not triggering double doors correctly.
Improved code efficiency.

=========
v3.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.1: Fixed incorrect behaviour when opening a single door.

=========
v3.0: The Recursive Update!
With the config option 'enableRecursiveOpening' you can now open multiple door-type blocks when they are connected. By default those which are connected and a maximum of 10 blocks away.

=========
v2.5: (Forge only) Updated backend code. Released an up-to-date 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.3: Updated Double Doors to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Added config options to disable separate functions within the mod.

=========
v2.1: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v2.0: The mod is now compatible with doors, trapdoors and fence gates.
Double doors can now be triggered by a single pressure plate or button.
Also works with fence gates/trapdoors which are on top of each other.

=========
v1.2: Opening a double door now makes sound.

=========
v1.1: Code improvement.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
