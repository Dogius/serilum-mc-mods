Changelog:
Omega Mute
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/omega-mute

=========
v1.9: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.8: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.7: Updated Omega Mute to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.6: Fixed the mod preventing a server from launching when included in the mods folder. This is a client-side only mod, but the server will ignore it when present.

=========
v1.5: Fixed hotkey firing when typing in an open chat.

=========
v1.4: You can now use the omega mute commands without cheats-access. Added configurable hotkey to reload the omega mute sound file. By default it's a dot .

=========
v1.3: [1.16.1 only] Updated mod to work with forge version 32.0.67 and above.

=========
v1.2: Fixed the mod causing issues when being loaded in a server environment. It just does nothing now.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Added culling feature, see the description for more details. For example, you can now play a sound every 10 seconds. Immersive yet not distracting.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
