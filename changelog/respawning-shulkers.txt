Changelog:
Respawning Shulkers
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/respawning-shulkers

=========
v1.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated Respawning Shulkers to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Added config option 'shulkersFromSpawnersDoNotRespawn' which when enabled prevents shulkers which originate from spawners to respawn. Enabled by default.

=========
v1.2: Improved code efficiency. Changed default respawn delay from 600 to 1200 ticks.

=========
v1.1: Pending shulker spawns will now process immediately on a server/world shutdown.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
