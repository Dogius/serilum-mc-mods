https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gui-followers

=========
v1.7: Updated various parts of the mod to improve how it handles followers. This also fixes an issue of the wrong follower being displayed.

=========
v1.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed the wrong posestack being used to render the GUI text.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated GUI Followers to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Fixed followers showing up in the list when they are located in different dimensions.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
